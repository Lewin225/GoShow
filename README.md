	* *Keyboard*
	* *Game Controlers / Joysticks*

	* **Open Pixel Control** - Mostly functional, Data format is not correct but still works
	* *Desktop Window* - Render your Texture2D nodes to another window - Requires godot4 (Partial implementation currently)

# Code of Conduct

This program is FEUDALWARE.
Contributors must swear fealty to the king of the code. (https://github.com/Lewin225)
Users are requested to tithe.

### Your pledge

"I promise on my faith that I will in the future be faithful to the king, never
cause him detriment of code quality, and will pay homage to him in features and
fixes, in good faith and without deceit."

### Your responsibilities to your fellow lords

Try to avoid infighting. In the event of unreconcilable differences the king
may dismiss contributors at his discretion for the good of the kingdom.

### Your responsibilities to your serfs and vassals

Try to generally treat them well, we don't want a riot on our hands.
Problematic and useless serfs may be disposed of freely.
Inefficiency will be seen as weakness.
